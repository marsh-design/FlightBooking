# FlightBooking
The objective of this lab was for COE 528 (Object Oriented Programming) to review Java, JUnit, and Netbeans, as well as to practice writing subclasses, using aggregation, and using instance and static variables. The lab involves implementing a simple model of a flight booking system, using six classes.

In this lab, I implementing a simple model of a flight booking system. The system have Flight objects (representing flights) and passengers (either frequent flyer members or non-members) who want to book a flight for travel. If a seat is available on a given flight, a ticket will be issued at a price depending on the passenger's membership status.


Flight: This class represents a flight. It has instance variables for the flight number, origin, destination, departure time, capacity, number of seats left, and original price. It has a constructor, getters
